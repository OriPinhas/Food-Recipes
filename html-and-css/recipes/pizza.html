        <p id="pizzarecipe">This thin-crust pizza dough recipe is ready to bake in just 15 minutes 
        with deliciously crisp results.</p>


        <h2 class="ing"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></h2>

            <ul id="pizzaingredients">
                <li><strong><span>Yeast:</span></strong> This thin crust pizza dough starts with one 
                teaspoon of active dry yeast.</li>
 
                <li><strong><span>Sugar and Water:</span></strong>  Activate the yeast in white
                 sugar and lukewarm water.</li>

                <li><strong><span>Flour:</span></strong> This crispy thin crust calls for 
                all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.</li>

                <li><strong><span>Salt:</span></strong> Salt tightens the gluten
                 structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic.</li>
             </ul>

            <h2 class="stepscl"><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
            <ol id="pizzastepsorder">
                <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees
                 F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast
                softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>

                <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. 
                Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>

                 <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, 
                about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too
                sticky.</li>

                <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
            </ol>
